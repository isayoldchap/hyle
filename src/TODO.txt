1. Decouple the colors from the game and board representation
    a. Each unique color can be represented as an integer (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 on the 5x5 board)
    b. The presentation layer can then map the integer for each distinct game piece to a game tile. This will allow for theming.
2. Repackage the code into a more suitable structure. Something like this:

    src/
        /css
        /fonts
        /js
            /redux
                /actions
                /selectors
                /reducers
            /react
                /components  
            /engine
            /util

3. Integrate the drag and drop UI board with the updated game engine    
4. Do something decent with the CSS/layout
5. Get some decent fonts working
6. Make a decision on whether to continue with material UI or do something else. Check with Rick
7. Remove export defaults because they suck
8.
